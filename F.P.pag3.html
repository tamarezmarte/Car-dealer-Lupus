    <p>The MP4-12C, launched in 2011,<br>
         kicked off McLaren's road-car business,<br>
     and was designed to revolutionize the supercar genre,<br>
     just as it did to hypercars nearly<br>
      two decades before with the F1,<br>
      this time pushing the boundaries not only in performance,<br>
       but also its usability.

<img src="Porsche 718 Boxster.png"class="carros" width="300"> <p>
    The 987 Porsche Boxster was launched in the mid-2000s and<br>
     reaped the rewards of the company-saving<br>
     original while building on its formula.<br>
     Following the line of the 997 generation of the 911, <br>
     the Boxster also lost the “fried egg” <br>
     headlights that enraged fans of the classic<br>
      circular design of previous generations.

    <img src="Chevrolet Corvette C6.png"class="carros" width="310"><p>
    The C6 Corvette was fairly revolutionary for the nameplate. <br>
    Sales didn't commence until the 2005 model year,<br>
     but Chevy started development in 2000.<br>
     Those five years paid off, however, <br>
     as the C6 Corvette brought with it a lot of firsts.<br>
      The most important change that came with the C6 is, arguably,<br>
       the fact that it was nearly five inches shorter than the C5 Corvette,<br>
        yet it rode on a longer wheelbase -<br>
         something that led to drastically improved handling.

    <img src="BMW M3 E46.png"class="carros" width="300" height="200"><p>
        Arguably the most popular generation of BMW M3,<br>
         the E46 was offered in both coupe and cabriolet<br>
          form and delivered “Joy Of Driving” by the buckets.<br>
          The E46 is the last M3 to feature<br>
           the classic non-turbocharged inline-six engine, with U.S.<br>
           models capable of putting out 338 horsepower<br>
           \ and sprinting to 62 mph in around five seconds on a good day.

    <img src="nissan 350Z.png"class="carros" width="300" height="200" ><p>
        The Nissan 350Z was a bit <br>
        of a savior for the Nissan brand.<br>
     When the 350Z launched in 2002, the U.S.<br>
      market hadn't seen a Z car in six years.<br>
      Nissan claimed from the start that the 350Z<br>
       was based on a "sleek redesign of 240Z DNA,<br>
      " anyone would be hard-pressed<br>
       to find the accuracy in that statement at a glance.

    <img src="Ferrari F40.png"class="carros" width="310" height="200"><p>
        The mid-engine rear-wheel drive Ferrari F40 <br>
        was produced from 1987 to 1992,<br>
     designed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Ferrari<br>
      (and was followed by the F50).<br>
      The performance and style draw Chicago drivers<br>
       to the F40, but for many collectors,<br>
       this is a particularly special model<br>
        not for what it is but for how it was made.
